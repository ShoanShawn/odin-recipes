<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Making pizza is one of the simplest and most complex things you can do, Certain aspects of it is very controllable and others are moreso semi-random.
    It is important to remove any sort of outside factor so for the recipe I would recommend having fresh ingredients, imparticular to the cheese, yeast, and sauce.
    The other ingredients freshness are definitely still important, but a much lesser degree.
    Without futher ado, let's get that dough.
</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Flour: 2 cups</li>
    <li>Water: 1 cup</li>
    <li>Sugar: 1 tbs</li>
    <li>Salt: 1 tsp</li>
    <li>Yeast: 1 tsp to 2 tsp (depending on rise time)</li>
    <li>Olive Oil: 1tbs to 2 tbs (preference)</li>
    <li>Sauce</li>
    <li>Cheese</li>
    <li>Toppings</li>
</ul>
<ol>
    <li>First thing to do is get your yeast going with your water and sugar </li>
    <li>Next you need to mix it with your other dough ingredients (the ones that have amounts listed)
        <em>besides</em> olive oil, <em>unless</em> you plan to knead your dough by hand.
    </li>
    <li>Start kneading the dough (preferably in a mixer) maybe for about 5 minutes. 
        This is the finnicky part, you might need to add more flour or water, when you have about 2 mins left add your oil.</li>
